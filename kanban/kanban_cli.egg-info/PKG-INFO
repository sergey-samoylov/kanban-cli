# 🧮 Terminal Kanban Board

A visually appealing **terminal-based Kanban board**  
powered by the [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) library.  

Tasks are organized in three statuses:   
**TODO**, **NOW**, and **DONE**,  
displayed either **horizontally or vertically**.

Each task belongs to a **custom category**,  
and each category is assigned a **unique color** for visual grouping.

Data is stored in a simple **CSV file**,  
and all configuration is handled with a **Python dictionary file**.

## 📁 Configuration

All configuration (category colors, layout) is stored in `config.py` as a dictionary:

```python
CONFIG = {
    "category_colors": {
        "code": "cyan",
        "shop": "green",
    },
    "layout": "columns"
}
```

Colors are randomly assigned to new categories (avoiding duplicates), but can
be changed by the user with `:c`.

## 🧱 Scalability

- Designed to be modular and extensible.
- Easy to switch to JSON or database backend in future.
- Ready for multi-file/project/task view if needed.
